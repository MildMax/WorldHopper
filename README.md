WorldHopper is a 2D playformer that requires the player to switch between worlds to complete puzzles.

This is a Work in Progress! What is in this repository is a bare-bones idea of what the game will look like. 
Currently, I am looking into changing the art direction (the sprites you see are part of a free package 
at https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-deluxe , and while I greatly appreciate the artist
giving his work out for free, I really like this game idea and want to make it something unique, and given
the world hopping nature of the game, I think there's a lot of potential for crossing different styles,
eras, and story ideas!) and introducing a story. At present, I am getting my Masters in CS while working
to support myself, and do not have the bandwidth to do this game justice. 

To play what's available, go to the 'build' folder and run the WorldHopper executable. Use the Unity
interface to start the game, navigate to "Levels", select "Test Level" and give it a go. 

Controls:
A -> Left
D -> Right
S -> go down faster
LeftClick -> use item
RightClick -> Change item
1,2 -> switch worlds
z,x -> preview worlds
esc -> menu

Have fun!
